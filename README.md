# FRC2020

This is the 2020 repository of the FRC team 972 Ironclaw.

The project board for this repository is located [here](https://github.com/iron-claw-972/FRC2020/projects/1). Feel free to assign yourself to tasks and to complete them.

# Code Structure

Overall the code structure is very basic and may be in some need of revising. Under ~\src\main\java\frc\robot there are two directories, described below. In addion there are two files, robot.java and main.java, which control robot functions at the highest level.

## Controllers

Pretty much everything that controls a specific action that the robot can take, this includes the conventional subsystems.

## Util

All of the general purpose classes that are used throughout the robot code.

## Online library import links

Do `ctrl-shift-p` to open the quick actions bar, then select manage vendor libraries. From there select `install new library (online)` and paste the urls below before pressing `ok`.
